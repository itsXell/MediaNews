Moreover, they will able to sort the searched news with Upload date or Relevance.

For instance, the filter value is just update, the view will reload instantly to find the new article for the end-user. Plus code is so clean since tableView.reload() does not have to call everytime something update.
The search history are store in persistent storage as well for the convenience and usefulness of the user experience. The search history in the persistent storage will expire in 7 days !
